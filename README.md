# How to use

To run this project, use the [website link](https://inventorycrud.netlify.app/) because the API keys are private and so it can't be run locally unless you have them.

## Create: 
To create a new inventory item, hit the green button and fill in the details. Make sure you're filling in mostly nice numbers
and be sure to use a unique name.
## Read: 
All the products in the database are viewable from the homepage and update as you add or delete more. It persists between loads.
## Update:
To update a product, click on the card and change the fields, then hit the save button. Once you have saved you can go back or refresh the page
and see your changes.
## Delete:
To delete a product, click on the card and hit the delete button. You will be taken home.

# Extra feature
The extra feature I implemented is the blue button on the homepage which saves the file data to a CSV file and downloads it to your computer as
Inventory.csv.
